1) To start up grid with two nodes - execute start-grid.bat ( from cmd or just double-click on .bat file).
 - this .bat file can be open and edited via any text editor and .bat itself simplifies start of grid infrastracture ( instread of starting hub and nodes separately)
2) Node configurations are stored in .json files.
3)kill_all.bat run script to kill all java.exe processes.
4)paths to chrome,ie,firefox and other drivers need to be specified.
