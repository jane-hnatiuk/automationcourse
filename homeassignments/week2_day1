1. For those who don't have their own website they want to test:

    Automate the following scenario:
  1) Search for "iphone" on http://hotline.ua
  2) Filter the found result by price ( filter by "Цена" attribute).
  3) Check that all the filtered results' prices are within the price range you selected (e.g  price range - between 3500 and 5000 uah ,    check that each result price are between 3500 and 5000 uah)
  4) OPTIONAL: check that number of results are the same as numbers shown next to price range  ( e.g.   3500 - 5000 uah (4)) ->  you need to check that number of the filtered results is 4)

  Requirements:
  1)Test should be written as a Junit method annotated with @Test annotation ( the same as we did in class)
  2)OPTIONAL: use PageObject pattern to encapsulate/hide technical details about web pages
