### Rules to be followed ###

1. Everyone should work **ONLY** with his/her own module. No changes should be made to other modules.
2. In order to complete home assignments you should follow the next steps:
 - Update your local master repository to the newest commit, execute **git pull**
   in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.
 - Create a new branch based on the latest master branch. Use "name_surname_homework_number" naming template for the branch.
 - Complete assignments in the branch you've created.
 - Push the "homework1" branch to the remote repository
 - Create a pull request to merge your "homework" branch into the master. Assign the pull request to me.
 
3. Don't commit non-working code.
